This directory contains Escort web browser.

Escort web browser, currently being developed as one of the ES operating
system projects, contains a totally new CSS/HTML rendering engine written
in C++11, and it can be configured with SpiderMonkey or V8 JavaScript
engine along with the C++11 Web IDL binding of the esidl Web IDL compiler.
For the graphics backend, Escort web browser uses OpenGL for the better
performance and portability.

The core components of the Escort web browser will be used like a window
system in today's operating systems in the ES operating system, but before
doing so, we are experimenting it as a standalone web browser on Linux.
The user interface of the Escort web browser itself is written in HTML/CSS
and JavaScript on top of the Escort core components.
